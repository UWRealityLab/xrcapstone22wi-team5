<h2 class="section-heading">What we have accomplished</h2>

- <b>Johnathon</b>: Imported new purchased kitchen assets, created new
  temperature and cooking scripts for dish components, and began work on prefab
  interactivity with the new assets.
- <b>Katherine</b>: Finalized MVP and target product, imported color change
  cooking script, and researched how to implement UI for object information.
- <b>Laksh</b>: Researched on more assets for kitchen and different food items
  and started looking into Photon PUN for multiplayer integrations.
- <b>Hritik</b>: Looked into how to go about making fries and started working on
  implementing them. Started with a single cuboid and added different shades to
  mimic real fries.
