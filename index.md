# Bon Appetit

## Project Description

Work in a gourmet kitchen and team up with 2 of your friends to try and complete
orders with realistic dishes. This game simulates the intensity of a 5-star
restaurant, and you will need teamwork in order to make the cut!

## Team Members

### Johnathon Leon Guerrero

Hello! I’m a senior in computer engineering at UW currently living close to
campus. Over the summer, I was an intern for Zillow Group where I focused on
front-end and back-end web development and scripting. My experience working as a
busser and line cook at the (now defunct) Tula Bene Pasteria served as the
inspiration for this project. Despite being brand new to VR development and game
design, I’m very excited to bring this vision to life.

### Laksh Gupta

Heyo! I’m a senior at UW and I love working with new technologies. I’m looking
forward to working with the new VR/AR technologies and to seeing all kinds of
new innovations we develop from it. I have some experience working with android
app development and back-end networking and I am excited to learn more about
unity development this quarter.

### Hritik Aggarwal

Hi! I am a senior at UW who loves creating new tools and technologies.
Currently, I am exploring the space of making mobile apps using React Native and
VR using Unity and Oculus. In the past, I have worked on different platforms
including iOS, Android, Web, Windows Platform, and even the Xbox Console. I am
super excited to work on this idea and bring my experience/skills to the table.
