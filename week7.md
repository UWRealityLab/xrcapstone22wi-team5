# Week 7 - Post-MVP, new lobby, bugfixes, playability improvements...

## What we have accomplished

- Johnathon: Organized feedback from MVP testing and distributed bug-fixing work to the team, worked on fixing plating bugs, audio improvements, and new gameplay features for upcoming new dishes.
- Katherine: Started developing a tutorial/tips system. The tutorial system will walk the user through the roles and explain the game mechanics. 
- Laksh:
- Hritik: Started fixing bugs that were reported from user testing and working on adding new features as noted in the MVP bugs section.

## New features/functionality implemented
- Grating! Shred some cheese or truffle over a dish to instantly up the fanciness factor.
- Cooking torch! Great for making creme brulee or for finishing french onion soup...
- More realistic temperature response! Items removed from heat will now continue to cook for a little longer

## Bug Fixes

- Violent plating collisions should be significantly reduced
- Items fall from plate if rotated enough
- Volume lowered in main scene
- Collisions in drawers should be more accurate
- Held objects should be less jittery now
