    <h2 class="section-heading">What we have accomplished</h2>

    <p><b>Johnathon</b></p>
    <p>
      Worked on prototyping a basic temperature system and stovetop function for
      the individual demo, refined the project pitch, and researched into
      required assets and budgeting
    </p>

    <p><b>Katherine</b></p>
    <p>
      Prototyped a boiling system that shows the color of an object changing as
      it is being cooked, and created the skeleton of this website.
    </p>

    <p><b>Laksh</b></p>
    <p>
      Implemented scripts for managing the UI for the game and object spawning
      using buttons, and researched about some assets for our cooking game, like
      models for food ingredients and dishes.
    </p>

    <p><b>Hritik</b></p>
    <p>
      Researched other applications like cookout that have a similar or somewhat
      overlapping user base, and looked into ideas and assets and how they could
      fit the space better.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Idea update</h2>

        to the other players
      </li>
      <li>
        Station chefs will be in charge of cooking the orders, with instructions
        from the head chef
