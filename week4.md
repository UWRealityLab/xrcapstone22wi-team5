# Week 4 - Basic features, liquid physics, 

## What we have accomplished

- Johnathon: Started project wiki, wrote pouring and filling scripts for liquids, made interactable prefabs for kitchen environment, fixed player/object collisions
- Katherine: Implemented a basic UI system for seeing object information (item name, temperature).
- Laksh: 
- Hritik: 

## New features/functionality implemented

- Interactable kitchen fixtures! Knobs can be turned, doors and drawers can be opened, and objects properly interact with them due to compound primitive hit boxes
- Liquid containers! Containers can be filled, pour liquid, or be scooped from using a single script. These containers visibly transform depending on how much liquid they are holding
- Ladle! A working ladle. Not much more to say
- 
## Bug Fixes
- Held objects and players no longer clip through static objects.
