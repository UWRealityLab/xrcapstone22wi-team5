# Weeks 1+2 - Getting started + project ideas

## What we have accomplished

- Johnathon: Worked on prototyping a basic temperature system and stovetop
  function for the individual demo, refined the project pitch, and researched
  into required assets and budgeting
- Katherine: Prototyped a boiling system that shows the color of an object
  changing as it is being cooked, and created the skeleton of this website.
- Laksh: Implemented scripts for managing the UI for the game and object
  spawning using buttons, and researched about some assets for our cooking game,
  like models for food ingredients and dishes.
- Hritik: Researched other applications like cookout that have a similar or
  somewhat overlapping user base, and looked into ideas and assets and how they
  could fit the space better.

## Idea update

- Co-op line cooking game set in a gourmet French Kitchen
- Orders will be completed by coordinating with other players
- Each player will have a specific role
  - Head chefs will be in charge of receiving orders and giving instructions to
    the other players
  - Station chefs will be in charge of cooking the orders, with instructions
    from the head chef
- Focus will be on teamwork and cooking, not the prep work. This includes
  - Boiling
  - Sauteing
  - Baking
  - Plating
  - Garnishing
  - and more...
- Use realistic recipes with measurements
- MVP will focus on:
  - 3 player co-op
  - 1 recipe: steak frites (steak, fries, bearnaise sauce)
  - Supports the following functions:
    - Frying
    - Baking
    - Sauteing
    - Garnishing
  - Temperature-checking system
  - Ticketing system for head chef
  - Rating system for final delivered food

## New features/functionality implemented

Basic functionalities prototyped in our demos which will be imported into the
project:

- A boiling script that changes the color of the object as it is being cooked
- Created some basic UI elements like canvases and buttons
- An object spawning script
- A working stovetop with multiple heat settings
- A basic temperature script for tracking cooking progress
- Steak asset responds to being cooked
